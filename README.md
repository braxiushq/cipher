# Cipher

**The encrypted cloud storage from your terminal.**

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL_3.0-blue.svg)

Cipher is an interactive terminal client for secure cloud storage, built with [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) and [Bun](https://bun.sh). All encryption happens locally on your machine — the server never sees your data or filenames.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/braxius-hq/cipher/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (Beta)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/braxius-hq/cipher/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Overview

Cipher lets you upload, download, and manage files in the cloud with true zero-knowledge encryption. Every file and all metadata (including filenames) is encrypted before leaving your machine. The server stores only encrypted blobs — it has no knowledge of what you are storing.

Built as a fully interactive TUI (terminal user interface) — no GUI required.

## Security Model: Zero-Knowledge Encryption

Cipher implements strict end-to-end encryption. Your data is encrypted locally before it ever reaches the network.

- **Account Keys:** Argon2id key derivation generates local master keys from your password. The server never receives your password or derived keys.
- **File Encryption:** Each file is encrypted with a unique AES-256-GCM key. That file key is then encrypted with a Libsodium asymmetric public key, so only you can decrypt it.
- **Metadata:** File and folder names are AES-256-GCM encrypted. The server stores only ciphertext — zero knowledge of your file structure or contents.

## Features

- E2EE file upload and download (streaming, chunked AES-256-GCM)
- Encrypted folder creation, rename, and deletion
- Encrypted metadata (filenames are never exposed to the server)
- Interactive terminal UI with keyboard navigation
- OTP-based authentication
- Self-upgrade mechanism
- Support for large files via streaming encryption (no memory bloat)
