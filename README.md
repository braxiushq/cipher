# Cipher

An end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) cloud storage client.

Cipher is a fully-featured, interactive terminal file manager built with [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) and [Bun](https://bun.sh). It provides a secure way to manage your files entirely from the command line.

## Security Model: Zero-Knowledge Encryption
Cipher implements strict end-to-end encryption. Your data is encrypted locally on your machine before it is ever sent to the network.
- **Account Keys:** Uses Argon2id key derivation to generate local Master Keys.
- **File Encryption:** Each file is encrypted with a unique AES-256-GCM key, which is itself encrypted using a Libsodium asymmetric public key system. 
- **Metadata:** File and folder names are also AES-256-GCM encrypted. The server has zero knowledge of what you are storing.
